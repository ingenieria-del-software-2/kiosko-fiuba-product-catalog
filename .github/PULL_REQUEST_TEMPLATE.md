# Product Catalog Service Refactoring

## Description

This PR refactors the product repository to address code complexity issues and improve type safety.

### Changes:

- Refactored the complex `_update_basic_fields` method by:
  - Breaking it down into 5 smaller, focused methods
  - Each method handles a specific group of fields (name/description, pricing, inventory, attributes, features)
  - Reduced complexity from 22 to below the threshold of 10

- Refactored the `_build_filter_conditions` method by:
  - Breaking it into 3 smaller methods for different filter types
  - Each method handles a specific type of filter (basic, search, additional)
  - Improved readability and maintainability

- Added proper type annotations for all methods:
  - Added return type annotations for all private methods
  - Added parameter type annotations
  - Fixed usage of `any` to `Any` for proper typing
  - Added proper type hints for collection types
